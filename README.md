# Mastermind for The Odin Project

## Status ⚠ ️ Abandoned ⚠
I've decided to stop working on this project because I lost motivation.
The main goal of making this project was to understand OOP while working with ruby.
I think I have achieved capability working with objects in ruby, and doing this project is no fun, so given that I've decided to pass onto other subjects.

For instance the only big challenge that I haven't accomplished is setting up the computer algorithm  for guessing the numbers.
Other than that this code only needs a refactor and some rewriting in order to be more readable.

Thanks for reading :) ~ MiDDiz
